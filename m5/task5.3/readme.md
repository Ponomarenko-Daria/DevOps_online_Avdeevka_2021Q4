### Task 5.3

<details><summary>Part 1</summary>

1. How many states could has a process in Linux?</p>
There are four Linux process states. They are as follows: running & runnable, sleep, stopped, and zombie.   
- Runinng & runnable process state - the process is either running or ready to run.
- Sleep process state - the process is waiting for some to occur or system resources to be allocated. There are two types of these processes:
    - interruptible waiting processes;
    - uninterrupted waiting processes.

- Stopped process state - the process has been stopped.

- Zombie process state - sometimes, when the parent process is killed before the child process terminates, the child processes become orphaned, with the init process assigned as the new parent.
</p>

2.  Examine the pstree command. Make output (highlight) the chain (ancestors) of the current process.  </p>
Syntax:

        pstree [OPTIONS] [UserName or PID]

<img src="1.1"></p>  
Selected the chain of ancestors of the current process:

3.  What is a proc file system?  </p>
The /proc filesystem is a virtual filesystem. It does not take up disk space. Its main task is to obtain the state of the system and partially perform control actions.
</p>

4. Print information about the processor (its type, supported technologies, etc.)</p>  
We can display information about the CPU using the commands

        lscpu
    and

        cat /proc/cpuinfo

    <img src="1.3"></p>
    <img src="1.4"></p>
</p>

5. Use the ps command to get information about the process. The information should be as 
follows: the owner of the process, the arguments with which the process was launched for 
execution, the group owner of this process, etc.</p>

</p>

6. How to define kernel processes and user processes?  </p>
Kernel processes are displayed using the command:

        ps --ppid=2 --pid=2
    <img src="1.6"></p>
    To display user processes, I use the command:

        ps -N --ppid=2 --pid=2
    <img src="1.7"></p>
</p>

7. Print the list of processes to the terminal. Briefly describe the statuses of the processes. 
What condition are they in, or can they be arriving in? </p>
 To display all processes on the screen, use the command:

        ps -aux

<img src="2.1"></p>

- R - the process is running or ready to run (ready state)
- D - process in a "dreamless sleep" - waiting for disk I/O
- T - the process is stopped (stopped) or traced by the debugger
- S - the process is in a state of waiting (sleeping)
- Z - zombie process
- < - process with negative nice value
- N is a process with a positive nice value 
</p>

8. . Display only the processes of a specific user.</p> 
If you need to see the processes performed by a specific user, use the command:

        ps U <UserName>

    For example:

        ps U ubuntu
<img src="1.8"></p>
</p>

9. . What utilities can be used to analyze existing running tasks (by analyzing the help for the ps 
command)?</p>
Looking at the help for the ps command, we can see that commands such as pgrep, pstree, top and proc can also be used.

</p>

10. What information does top command display?</p>
The top command allows you to display information about the system, as well as a list of processes, dynamically updating information about the resources they consume.
</p>

11.  Display the processes of the specific user using the top command.</p>
To display processes running on behalf of a specific user, use the command:

        top -u ubuntu
<img src="1.9"></p>
</p>

 12. What interactive commands can be used to control the top command? Give a couple of examples.</p>
To control the TOP utility, we can use interactive commands while working with it, so here are some examples:

- h - output help on the utility;
- q or Esc - exit from top;
- A - choice of color scheme;
- d or s - change the interval for updating information;
- H - output process flows;
- k - send a termination signal to the process;
- W - write the current program settings to the configuration file;
- Y - view additional information about the process, open files, ports, logs, etc.;
- Z - change color scheme;
- l - hide or display information about the average load on the system;
- m - turn off or switch the mode of displaying information about the memory;
- x - bold the column by which sorting is performed;
- y - bold processes that are currently running;
- z - switching between color and single color modes;
- c - switching the command output mode, the full path and only the command are available;
- F - setting fields with information about processes;
- o - filtering processes by an arbitrary condition;
- u - filtering processes by username;
- V - display of processes in the form of a tree;
- i - switching the display mode of processes that are not currently using processor resources;
- n - the maximum number of processes to display in the program;
- L - search by word;
- <> - moving the sort field to the right and left;

</p>

 13. Sort the contents of the processes window using various parameters (for example, the 
amount of processor time taken up, etc.)</p>
To sort the output, use the following command:

        ps -ef --sort [sortcolumns]

For example:
<img src="2.3"></p>
<img src="2.4"></p>
<img src="2.5"></p>
<img src="2.6"></p>
</p>

14. Concept of priority, what commands are used to set priority?</p>
Each process in the system is assigned a certain priority, which is taken into account by the process scheduler when allocating processor time to the process. The priority value ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest: the process only runs when there are no other CPU time contenders). The reciprocal value of priority is called the indicator of compliance (nice).  
By default, all processes start with a base priority of 0. The owner of a process can raise its compliance score (lower priority) at any time. The superuser has the right to set any priority value for any process.  
nice - set priority for launched process;
Syntax:

        nice -nice_value command-arguments

    Example: 

        nice -5 wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
</p>

 15. Can I change the priority of a process using the top command? If so, how?</p>
 We can change the priority of a process using the top command with the r key.

We use the top command, then press the r key and change the desired values.

</p>

 16. Examine the kill command. How to send with the kill command
process control signal? Give an example of commonly used signals.</p> 
By executing the kill command, a signal is sent to the system indicating the incorrect operation of the application.
To view all signals, use the command:

    kill -l

<img src="2.8"></p>

To send a signal to a process (or group of processes), you can use the kill command in the following form:

    kill -signal PID[PID..]

</p>

 17. Commands jobs, fg, bg, nohup. What are they for? Use the sleep, yes command to demonstrate the process control mechanism with fg, bg.</p>
 - jobs - allows to see what commands is in our session;
- fg - let to bring command from background to foreground;
- bg - allows to push command from foreground to background;
- nohup - let to save started process after a closing terminal session.

 1. Check the implementability of the most frequently used OPENSSH commands in the MS Windows operating system. (Description of the expected result of the commands + screenshots: command â€“ result should be presented)
</p>
The most popular commands to use OpenSSH in OS Windows is:
ssh login@address to connect to the server. 
ssh-keygen to generate new pair of keys.
ssh-add "path\to\key" to add key and connecting without using the path in cli.
scp "path\in\windows" login@adress:/"path/on/server"

</p>

2. Implement basic SSH settings to increase the security of the client-server connection (at least </p>
To improve security, you can use the following settings:
- use another port (different from 22);
- use strong password and username;
- disable login for root account;
- disable empty password;
- configure idle timeout interval;
- use public/private keys for authification;
- forbid connection by a password authentication.

</p>

3. List the options for choosing keys for encryption in SSH. Implement 3 of them. </p>
We can choose the following keys to encrypt in SSH:
- rsa;
- dsa;
- ecdsa;
- ed25519;
- ed25519-sk.
Use the 't' option to change the key type.  
Examples:
<img src="3.3"></p>
<img src="3.4"></p>
<img src="3.5"></p>
</p>

4. Implement port forwarding for the SSH client from the host machine to the guest Linux virtual machine behind NAT. </p>
